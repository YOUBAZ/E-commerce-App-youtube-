# Backend Deployment Fix Guide

## Issue Analysis
The 500 error on `/api/products` is caused by the database connection not being properly established in the Vercel environment.

## Solution Summary
I've updated the backend configuration to properly handle the database connection and server startup in the Vercel environment.

## Deployment Steps

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
Make sure these environment variables are set in Vercel:
- `MONGO_URI` (your MongoDB connection string)
- `NODE_ENV=production`

### 2. Updated Configuration
The backend is now properly configured with:
- ✅ Proper database connection handling
- ✅ Optimized server startup sequence
- ✅ Error handling for database connection failures

### 3. Verification Steps
After deployment:
1. Visit `/api/products` endpoint
2. Check that products are being fetched from the database
3. Verify that the database connection is working correctly

## Testing
The deployment should now work correctly with the updated configuration.
